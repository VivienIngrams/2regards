        2regards Atelier is a space dedicated to the creation of advertising
        content and visual arts, founded by Mathilde Cudeville and Paulo Bastos
        in 2019.One of the areas of action for 2regards is advertising, through
        the photography, video and graphic design. The Atelier has partnerships
        with various international companies.Additionally, the Atelier consists
        of an art gallery, where numerous national and international artists are
        welcomed throughout the year. The artistic component of the gallery is
        complemented by the analog photography laboratory, where training
        sessions for analog capture and development are facilitated. Paulo
        Bastos is a Portuguese video director based in Porto. After completing
        his higher education at HEI Lille in France, he worked as a civil
        engineering engineer. He expatriated to the USA, Central America, and
        the Nordic countries. His extensive travels fueled his passion for
        visual storytelling. In 2017, he embarked on a career as a video
        director. Currently, he collaborates with various clients in
        advertising, communication, and documentary projects through the company
        2regards, which he co-founded with his partner Mathilde Cudeville.
        Mathilde Cudeville absorbs the world around her and reflects it back
        with a highly personal poetic touch. She dissolves into the surroundings
        before revealing the most unusual elements, which are often the most
        expressive. Her connection to nature is profound, defending it by
        unveiling its absolute grandeur captured in the subtlest details. The
        same applies to her relationship with humanity. It was through
        initiating a dreamlike photopoetry collaboration that the extent of
        Mathilde's imagination became apparent to me, seemingly boundless. Our
        shared reverie gave rise to improbable shots with seemingly unrelated
        subjects, such as a lighthouse in Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, a naked man
        in a forest, or a Tuareg tent. Yet, the underlying thread, however
        faint, naturally unfolds before the viewer's eye. It is in this
        unrestrained creation and recreation that Mathilde's unique talent
        resides. The exploration of her previous and ongoing works further
        solidified this impression. Initially delving into insularity and
        isolated territories, notably through a documentary on the
        Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon archipelago ("Les onze mille vierges"), she
        then engaged in a correspondence book, playing the exquisite corpse game
        with a writer in Paris. This work is a fleeting photo/writing dialogue
        questioning the concept of solitude. Subsequently, she embarked on a
        series of self-portraits ("RÃªverie Odisseia"), baring herself both
        literally and figuratively, driven by the desire to explore herself more
        and more, body and soul intertwined. "En suspension (S)" follows a
        similarly liberated dual approach, using otherness as a vehicle, without
        artifice or mask. Speaking of the form, Mathildes artistic practice
        revolves around the photographic medium and silver printing, with her
        works oscillating between ambient photography and plastic photography.
        They are often exhibited in unexpected places, reflecting her daring
        nature. I invite poetry, intimacy, and uniqueness enthusiasts to meet
        Mathildes gaze. MICHEL LE ROUX Poet and friend
